## Random-Password-Generator
# Challenge#3 Week 3:
# Project Description
### What is this project?
This is Challenge#3 of bootcamp. It is an odd week where I am given code and I have to make the appropriate adjustments in order for it to work accordingly. Using JavaScript, I am given a password generator that appears to be broken. It is my goal to make the appropriate fixes and ensure that the code is working to standard!

### Files modified
The only file that  was modified, was the script.js file. As being an odd week for my bootcamp, I only had to edit a specific file.

### Challenges
The major challenge I had faced during this project was correcting my for-loop conditions. In this situation, I had struggled to ensure that my loop conditions were optimal. The issue lies when you mix more than one type of variable with another. As seen in my code, when you use only one variable it adheres to the length perfectly and randomly ordered. However, when you select two or more variables it appears to repeat the size of the length twice. I believe I know where the issue lies (please see // comments in code), however, I was unable to properly fix this problem.

# Installation
N/A

# Usage
This can be used by anyone who wants to take advantage of a password generator. Allowing for anyone to have a unique and secure password. Additionally this is my first time using Javascript, I hope that anyone who is to review this code, can view my progress from now and the next couple of weeks.
