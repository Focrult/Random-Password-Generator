## Random-Password-Generator
# Challenge#3 Week 3:
# Project Description
### What is this project?
This is Challenge#3 of bootcamp. An odd week where I am given code and I have to make the appropriate adjustments in order for it to work accordingly. Using JavaScript, I am given a password generator that appears to be broken. It is my goal for this project to make the appropriate fixes and ensure it is working by 1/12!

### Files modified
As mentioned, all I had to modify was the script.js file.


### Challenges
The major challenege I faced during this project was making use of the for loop. The for loop took a majority of my time to fix. 

# Installation
N/A

# Usage
This can be used by anyone who wants to take advantage of a password generator. Allowing for anyone to have a unique and secure password. Additionally this is my first time using Javascript, I hope that anyone who is to review this code, can view my progress from now and the next couple of weeks.
